        <h1>About GameNest</h1> 

        <!-- TODO: please rephrase this or add to it so it sounds better :) -->
        <p>GameNest is your one-stop destination to access several different simple browser games. 
            It is an online hub hosting a wide variety of games with a uniform, 
            aesthetically-pleasing GUI.</p>

        <h1>Technology Overview</h1>
        <p>Tech Stack: MERN. React client, Express and Node.js server, and MongoDB Database.</p>
        <p>Language(s): JavaScript</p>
        <p>Library(s): React</p>

        <h1>Battleship</h1>
        <p>This will be a simple networked 2 player battleship game. Both users will set up their ships on a 10 x 10 board 
            and take turns attempting to destroy each others ships.
        </p>
        <p>Battleship will use websockets to communicate with the clients when a shot is taken and to update board information. 
            A database will be used to keep track of game sessions so a user can close out of the window and rejoin the lobby later.
            Lobby tokens will be used to get users into the same lobby.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the future I want to implement better graphics integration with React, such as showing actual ships on the board.

        <h1>Wordle</h1>
        <p>This will be a simple Wordle game in which the user has 6 attempts to guess a 5-letter 
            word. As the user guesses words, their letters will be highlighted in gray if the letter
            is not present in the word, yellow if the letter is in the word but is in the wrong spot,
            and green if the letter is in the word and is already in the right spot.
        </p>
        <p>Wordle will utilize a database to keep track of the user's scores (assuming they are 
            logged in). Additionally, API calls to a separate web server will supply new random
            words everytime the user begins a new game.
        </p>
        <p>In the future, I may implement features where users can choose to guess words longer than
            the default 5 letters and to have more or less than 6 attempts.

        <h1>Dots and Boxes</h1>
        <p>Dots and Boxes is a simple well-known game that many people have played.
        </p>
        <p>Two players will take turns drawing horizontal or vertical lines to connect dots in order to form a box. 
            The player who is able to form the most boxes in the overall grid, wins.
        </p>
        <p>In this case, the user will be up against the computer. The application will be utilizing a database to 
            keep track of the user's scores against the computer, but if and only if, they are logged in. 
        </p>
        <p>In the future, I may want to implement features where the user can play against users, if not themselves too.

        <h1>Blackjack</h1>
        <p>Blackjack is one of, if not the most popular casino game in the world. 
           The game consists of a standard deck of cards, where each card represents a number (Face Cards are worth 10, Aces are 11 OR 1).
           The objective of this game is to have a hand of cards that is the closest to 21, without going over. 
        </p>
        <p>In my implementation of this game, the user will be playing against a dealer, 
            who will keep hitting until they either bust or are greater than the number the user decides to stand on.  
            The user's wins will be tracked in a MongoDB database.
        </p>
        <p>Some future ideas could be the implementation of a multiplayer function. 
            I am also considering implementing a money feature, 
            where other players are able to see how much money a user has generated from playing.</p>
